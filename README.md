# Talk to Santa

**Talk to Santa** is an interactive tool for my children, allowing them to engage in conversations with Santa Claus. This project leverages OpenAI and Eleven Labs technologies to create a fun experience for young kids. The user interface image was AI-generated using Microsoft Designer.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Enables children to talk to Santa in a realistic and engaging way.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Harnesses the power of OpenAI to facilitate natural conversations 
- **Voice Synthesis**: Incorporates Eleven Labs' Santa voice for realistic responses.
